					About Me
				</h1>
				<h6 className="text-sm">
					I am a passionate Computer Science senior at UNLV with a strong
					interest in software engineering, cybersecurity, and IT
					infrastructure. My coursework has primarily taught languages such
					C/C++, Assembly, and Java, while self-study has expanded my skills in
					JavaScript, Python, C#, and web development. <br />
					Beyond software, I gained hands-on IT experience as a Student AV
					Services Technician, troubleshooting Crestron Panels, displays and
					developing a deeper interest in networking and cybersecurity. I have
					earned CompTIA Network+ which led me to landing an internship in a
					Network Operations team at Southwest Gas. At this internhsip I got my
					CompTIA Security+ and AWS Cloud Practitioner certifications. <br />I
					am eager to pursue the more certifications and sharpen my skills and
					knowledge with programming languages and frameworks. I am actively
					seeking opportunities as a Full-Stack Developer, Cybersecurity
					Analyst, Network Engineer, or Cloud Engineer, driven by a commitment
					to continuous learning and innovation in technology.
