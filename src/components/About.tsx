				</h1>
				<p className="text-md">
					Welcome to my page! I'm a Senior Computer Science major at the
					University of Nevada, Las Vegas and I currently work with Southwest
					Gas Corporation as a Network Services Intern.
				</p>
				<br></br>
				<p className="text-md">
					Throughout college, I've gained a bit of experience in everything such
					as Machine Learning, Software Engineering, Cybersecurity, and Network
					Operations.
				</p>
				<br></br>
				<p className="text-md">
					I have experience in Full-Stack Development through internships and
					self-study, utilizing hybrid agile methodologies for project
					management and frontend and backend technologies, including
					JavaScript, React.js, Next.js, C#, and .NET, among others.
				</p>
				<br></br>
				<p className="text-md">
					As of 2025, I'm set to graduate in August and plan to further enhance
					my expertise by pursuing the AWS Solutions Architect and CompTIA
					CySA+, and Linux+ certifications. Additionally, I'm expanding my
					knowledge in network infrastructure configuration, maintenance, and
					security while refining my Full-Stack Development skills, particularly
					in React, Python, and Django.
				</p>
				<br></br>
				<p className="text-md">
					I'm actively seeking opportunities in Cybersecurity, Software
					Engineering, Cloud Engineering, Network Engineering, or really any
					sort of IT operations. I'm always open to any new opportunities and
